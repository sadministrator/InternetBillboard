# InternetBillboard: https://internet-billboard.vercel.app/
A dApp that displays a 'billboard', a message and image saved in a smart contract, and allows users to send transactions that can update it. A simple experimental dApp made in the spirit of decentralization and public access.

# Exploring Previous Billboards
You can explore all of the previous billboards posted by all users by clicking the 'previous' and 'next' buttons at the top of the screen.

# Submitting your own Billboard
Note: You will need the Metamask extension and some Rinkeby ETH in order to cover the transaction gas.

You can submit your own billboard by clicking the 'Submit New Billboard' button at the bottom of the page. You will be redirected to a form where you can enter your billboard's message and the URL for its image. Click on 'Submit' when you are finished and you will be prompted by Metamask to approve the transaction. Once the transaction has been approved and completed you will be redirected back to the homepage where you will see your newly posted billboard.
